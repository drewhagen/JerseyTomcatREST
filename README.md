This is a sample application using **RESTful services**, specifically
by using **Jersey** java framework, and **Apache Tomcat** server.

I will be following this Pluralsight course:
https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/restful-services-java-using-jersey

This project will be done in IntelliJ, with maven enabled.

Note: This application will also try to work with some existing Python
scripts (for data analysis) called with CLI commands using Java's ProcessBuilder.
Therefore, this is why Github claims this to be a 'Python' repo, when it really should be Java.

In the future, I am considering removing the Python scripts and adding them to a forked
version of this project, with the Java RESTful setup isolated here.
