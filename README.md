This is a sample application using **RESTful services**, specifically
by using **Jersey** java framework, and **Apache Tomcat** server.

I will be following this Pluralsight course:
https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/restful-services-java-using-jersey


This project will be done in IntelliJ, with maven enabled.

Followed this guide by Sam Jesso!:
